question: |
  Do you need to file a Motion?
subquestion: |
  A **Motion** is a formal request asking the court to do something.
  
  In most 1A divorces, you **don't need** to file a separate motion because everything
  is agreed upon and included in your Joint Petition and Separation Agreement.
  
  You might need a motion if:
  - You need to modify an existing order
  - You need the court to enforce something
  - You need emergency relief
  - You have a specific request not covered in your divorce forms
  
  **Do you need to file a Motion with your divorce?**

    help: |
      If unsure, you probably DON'T need a motion. Most uncontested divorces
      proceed without separate motions.
