  Child Support Guidelines Deviation
subquestion: |
  Massachusetts has standard **Child Support Guidelines** that determine
  the amount of child support based on income and other factors.
  
  In most cases, couples follow these guidelines exactly.
  
  However, you can **deviate** (differ) from the guidelines if you have good reasons,
  such as:
  
  - Extraordinary medical or educational expenses
  - Significant differences in parenting time from the standard
  - High income that makes guideline amount inappropriate
  - Other special circumstances
  
  **Are you and your spouse planning to deviate from the Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines?**

      If you're unsure, you're probably NOT deviating. Most couples follow
      the guidelines exactly.
