  **fee waiver** process for those who cannot afford to pay.
  
  To request a fee waiver, you'll need to file an **Affidavit of Indigency** (Form JD-CL-009).
  
  This form requires you to provide detailed financial information, including:
  - Income from all sources
  - Assets (bank accounts, property, vehicles)
  - Monthly expenses
  - Public benefits you receive
  
  We'll include this form with your packet. You'll need to:
  1. Fill it out completely and accurately
  2. Sign it under the penalties of perjury
  3. File it with your other divorce forms
  
  The court will review your financial situation and decide whether to waive or reduce the filing fees.
